This repository, aids to generate a prediction of when a product will match its sales price.

## Setting the story

A fictional company called WAX, manufactures a product mainly made by scrap steel. The owner, has detected that the price of the material he needs to make his product changes every time.
So now, he is worried that he will have to raise his prices again after 1 year. This fictional owner wants to keep competitive prices and keep them for long time, thus guaranteeing her clients stable prices in an ever changing economy.
The owner of WAX wants to be able to raise the prices of her product, in doing so she requires specific criteria: she does not want to change prices in two years at least, she does not want to raise them greatly,
she wants to keep her profit share safe in the next years, she has plans on expansion and she counts on investing on her company, so the price set must let her accomplish this expansion plans.

In this fictional story, I will play the role of a fictional Data Analyst. And in my role as such, I will show in this repository how is possible to predict the prices of the products of this fictional company and at the same time,
gave the owner valuable data so she can make decisions that can fit her criteria and her company plans.

## Strategy to tackle to problem

The product is made almost of scrap steel, and going to investment sites, is posible to retrieve the information of the scrap steel prices.

The owner has to have records of the prices of her own product, this will be useful.

Also, they should have prices of the supply material and these we can analyse by predicting the increment of the material in the coming months.

Information of the percentages of profit, investment and costs cover the price of the product should be needed.
